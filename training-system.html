            <h2>Training the System</h2>
            <p>This page will guide you on how to train your Parking Management System using the video data collected from your parking lot. Follow the steps below to understand the process of segmenting, analyzing, and identifying parking spaces.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Capture Video Frames</h3>
            <p>Video frames are captured from the installed cameras and stored for processing. This is crucial for analyzing the parking lot layout and the usual traffic flow.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Segment Images</h3>
            <p>Using advanced image processing techniques, the system segments the images to identify and differentiate parking spaces from other areas.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Create Masks</h3>
            <p>Masks are created to highlight the parking spaces, aiding in the precise detection of available spots.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Analyze Parking Space Dimensions</h3>
            <p>The dimensions of each parking space are calculated to ensure they meet specified criteria for size, helping in classification and management.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Define and Save Regions</h3>
            <p>Identifiable regions within the parking lot are defined and saved. This allows the system to recognize different areas and manage them accordingly.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 6: Overlay Information</h3>
            <p>The processed data is overlaid on live images from the parking lot to provide real-time visual feedback on parking availability.</p>
